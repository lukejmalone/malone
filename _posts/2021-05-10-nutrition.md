Since around my mid-teens, I've had a long history of health issues and many doctor and hospital trips as a resulting consequence. For many years I was constantly plagued with nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, migraines and every gastrointestinal issue you can imagine. Seeking out medical help proved mostly to be a dead-end as when it comes to healing through nutrition the medical field is still quite ignorant. I would like believe in the last decade though this has improved with the increased mainstream awareness of health products and healthy eating alternatives. However, at the time despite all my symptoms not a single doctor or GP ever enquired as to what I was eating and my attempts to bring it up would mostly be just dismissed or looked upon apathetically. Although I was offered plenty of pills. Despite swearing on the Hippocratic oath it seems many doctors have overlooked that Hippocrates also said "let food be thy medicine".

As a result, I turned to the internet for answers and immersed myself in the rabbit hole of nutrition. I learnt a lot about the world of food and diets - the good and the bad. It never ceases to surprise me just how cultish some people can be towards their eating habits and I've spent more hours than I'm proud to admit following vegan youtube drama. When it comes to different diets for health I've tried them all from gluten-free, keto, paleo, vegetarian etc. You name it I likely tried it or know about it. A lot of these diets have a lot in common and I experienced some form of improvement on all of them but it was also with mixed results as a lot of lingering symptoms simply never left me.

Throughout this time I started to build up my own awareness of what was aggravating to my body and I realised I was mostly struggling with carbohydrates in general whether it was wheat, potatoes, corn, or sometimes even rice it would all bring on my symptoms. Often just accumulating and gradually getting worse and worse.

Then from piecing all my patterns of ill health together I found The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) which addresses carbohydrate intolerance more broadly than the other approaches I had tried and importantly highlighted the role of intolerances. Understanding that it's not the food themselves but the byproducts of the ingestion of certain foods that can cause the intestinal problems. Now I don't believe there is a one-size-fits-all approach for diet, everything is individual. But when I was reading through Elaine Gottschall's book "Breaking the Vicious Cycle" the parallels between what she was saying and my experiences matched up perfectly.

The SCD was introduced in the 1920s by gastrointestinal Sidney Haas and popularised in the 1980s by Gottschall's book. The diet's guidelines are based on the claim that not everyone's digestive tract has evolved to optimally digest complex carbohydrates and other man-made food products.

Using her approach she was able to heal many patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and other severe intestinal issues. She also noticed other unanticipated benefits as patients with muscle aches, stiff joints, and even full-blown arthritis, chronic skin rashes, psoriasis, generalized fatigue and "spaciness" were alleviated as their intestinal toxicity was cleaned up. It was also shown to provide dramatic and fast recoveries in young children with behaviour problems including autistic-type hypoactivity and hyperactivity.

The main principle of the SCD is that only monosaccharide carbohydrates (the simplest carbohydrates) are allowed to be eaten as all others carbohydrates like disaccharides and polysaccharides require extra digestion steps to break the chemical bonds down to monosaccharide carbohydrates. For certain people eating these complex carbohydrates means there will be undigested carbohydrates which causes bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the intestinal tract. This starts a chain reaction of excess toxins and acids which irritate the small intestine cells damaging them and causing food absorption issues which leads to the vicious cycle Gottschall talks about in her book. Essentially, the SCD diet restricts food with two or more linked sugar molecules like dairy, starchy vegetables, grains, table sugar and most legumes.

Below is an outline of the foods that are allowed and not allowed on the SCD and make up the guidelines of how I try to eat on a day-to-day basis. Whilst this diet is quite restrictive, following it has alleviated a whole host of health issues I was experiencing and dramatically improved the quality of my day to day life.

### Allowed Foods

##### Proteins
* All meat like poultry, fish, beef, lamb and shellfish.
* All types of Eggs preferably organic and free-range.

##### Fruits
* Fresh or frozen fruit with no added sugar like bananas, apples, pears and many others.

##### Vegetables
* The majority of non-starchy fresh or frozen vegetables like carrots, onions, tomato, squashes and many others.

##### Dairy
* Natural cheeses where the whey is removed and remaining lactose is cured like cheddar, colby, parmesan, swiss and others.
* Home-made fermented yoghurt.
* Butter.

##### Nuts
* All nuts including almonds, macadamias, pecans, brazil nuts, walnuts and chestnuts.
* Coconut and coconut milk.

##### Beverages
* Fresh juice.
* Weak tea or coffee.

### Not Allowed Foods

##### Proteins
* Processed meats such as hot dogs, cold cuts, and fast food.
* Most smoked meat and fish.

##### Vegetables
* Potatoes, yams and other starchy root vegetables.

##### Fruits
* Canned fruit with additives that isn't it's own juice.
* Dried fruit.

##### Grains
* Grains including wheat, rice, corn, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, barley, spelt, rye, oats etc.
* Products derived from these grains like pasta, cereal, crackers, bread and other baked goods.

##### Dairy
* Milk.
* Processed cheese and fresh cheese like mozzarella and ricotta.
* Milk products such as ice cream and margarine.

##### Misc
* Sugar alcohols like maltodextrin, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol.
* MSG
* Sulphates and pectins.

Another approach to diet that I experienced great results on and could be beneficial to those with gastrointestinal issues is the low FODMAP diet. Whilst both these diets were created to reduce the amount of carbohydrates in the intestines the low FODMAP diet only restricts fermentable carbohydrates where the SCD restricts all sugars except for monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose). For those who struggle more with fructose malabsorption they may see better results on a low FODMAP diet.

However, the most important thing when it comes to food and what you eat is experimenting and seeing what works for you. Read what's out there, experiment and come to your own conclusions.
