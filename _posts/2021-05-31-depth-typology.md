Below is a walkthrough of the various stages that Jungian Depth Typology has taken over the years and my notes and synthesis from the pivotal resources of the formulation of these stages. These stages are as follows:
* The Cognitive Functions
* MBTI
* The Function Stack
* Beebe's Eight-Function Model

### Cognitive Functions
Carl Jung’s theory of type first formulated in his book *'Psychological Types'* outlined that everyone uses four basic mental functions or processes that are called **Sensing** (S), **Intuition** (N), **Thinking** (T) and **Feeling** (F).

These four functions are then further differentiated by which attitude they take on either that of **Extraversion** (E) or **Introversion** (I).

Jung has been quoted saying *"that we need a function to tell us what is, and that is sensation. We need a function to give it a name and that is thinking. We need a function to tell us what it is worth, and that’s feeling, and we need a function to tell us what its possibilities are, where it is headed, and that’s intuition".*

For more information specifically on how Jung saw the cognitive functions and his views in Psychological Types see my previous post [here](https://www.lukejmalone.com/psychological-types/).

Functions are in essence divisions of reality, into either perceiving or making judgements towards information in our environment.

Perceiving being about either the **tangible objects** themselves (S) or the **patterns and inferences** by the objects (N) and
Judging being about what is seen as **mechanically correct** (T) or what is **valued by people** (F).

These perspectives are then stimulated either through the **external and objective environment** (E) or an **individual’s subjective self-reference** (I).
The subject’s conscious ego processing the function can take on either the **objective** or **subjective** perspective.

The **subjective focus** (I) creates a model of the object, which it filters new objective data through, keeping what it deems useful, which is then integrated for new observations and decisions.

The **objective focus** (E) merges with the object, making it the new subjective element.

The attitude and functions can be described as:

**Extraversion** (E) purpose is attention or evaluation derived directly from the external object.
**Introversion** (I) purpose is attention or evaluation derived from the internal subjective blueprint.
**Sensation**  (S) registers space and reality as real and reacts accordingly.
**Intuition**  (N) registers the time implication of reality and puts it out as an idea.
**Thinking**  (T) assesses, understands, and responds to the way things work.
**Feeling**  (F) assesses, understands, and responds to the way people are affected.

When these functions are paired with either the object or subject attitude, we get the following eight Jungian functions. Below is their essential characteristics as described by Linda V. Berens in her book *'The Dynamics of Personality Type'*.

**Extraverted Sensing (Se)**: Directing energy outwardly and acquiring information by focusing on a detailed, accurate accumulation of sensory data in the present.
*	Experiencing, doing, observing, and responding, adapting, and varying and present focused.

### MBTI

In the 1960s Isabel Myers and Katherine Briggs further refined the type theory Jung outlined and created the **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator** or **MBTI**. Myer's and Brigg's built upon statements by Jung about the interaction of functions and also added the J-P dichotomy.

**Perception** (P) meaning all the ways of becoming aware of things, people, events, or ideas. It includes information gathering, the seeking of sensation or of inspiration, and the selection of stimulus to attend to. In the perceiving attitude, a person is attuned to incoming information.

**Judgement** (J) meaning all the ways of coming to conclusions about what has been perceived. It includes evaluation, choice, decision making, and the selection of a response after perceiving a stimulus. In the judging attitude, a person is concerned with making decisions, seeking closure, planning operations or organising activities.

With the MBTI system Myer's and Brigg's outlined **four preference dichotomies**.

* Two kinds of perception: **Sensing** (S) and **Intuition** (N)
* Two kinds of judgement: **Thinking** (T) and **Feeling** (F)
* Two kinds of energy: **Extraversion** (E) and **Introversion** (I)
* Two orientations to the outer world: **Judging** (J) and **Perceiving** (P)

They also built on Jung's description of an auxiliary function that supported and complemented the dominant function in every type. This changed Jung's system of eight dominant types to the MBTI model of sixteen types.

* Extraverts with dominant Sensing and auxiliary Thinking - **ESTP**.
* Extraverts with dominant Sensing and auxiliary Feeling - **ESFP**.
* Introverts with dominant Sensing and auxiliary Thinking - **ISTJ**.
* Introverts with dominant Sensing and auxiliary Feeling - **ISFJ**.
* Extraverts with dominant Intuition and auxiliary Thinking - **ENTP**.
* Extraverts with dominant Intuition and auxiliary Feeling - **ENFP**.
* Introverts with dominant Intuition and auxiliary Thinking - **INTJ**.
* Introverts with dominant Intuition and auxiliary Feeling - **INFJ**.
* Extraverts with dominant Thinking and auxiliary Sensing - **ESTJ**.
* Extraverts with dominant Thinking and auxiliary Intuition - **ENTJ**.
* Introverts with dominant Thinking and auxiliary Sensing - **ISTP**.
* Introverts with dominant Thinking and auxiliary Intuition - **INTP**.
* Extraverts with dominant Feeling and auxiliary Sensing - **ESFJ**.
* Extraverts with dominant Feeling and auxiliary Intuition - **ENFJ**.
* Introverts with dominant Feeling and auxiliary Sensing - **ISFP**.

### The Function Stack
Whilst the Myers Briggs Type Indicator focuses on discovering and systematising someone's preference between the four dichotomies, another popular interpretation and add-on of sorts to the personality instrument is the **"Harold Grant" function stack**. This is followed by many type theorists and often mistakenly believed to be part of the MBTI.

The function stack is a typical ordering of the cognitive functions for each type. With type being formed from the dominant function and attitude coupled with an auxiliary function which is other opposite judgement or perception and the opposite attitude. This is theorised from the need for cognitive balance and the need to be in tune with both the internal and external worlds.

The most popular order was first created by Harold Grant and takes on a mirror dynamic which stems from the way we split reality by choosing one perspective and by doing so suppress its opposite. The Harold Grant function stack is the four functions being placed in an **IEIE** or **EIEI** order.

Therefore using this function stack we get:

* ESTP = Se-Ti-Fe-Ni
* ESFP = Se-Fi-Te-Ni
* ISTJ = Si-Te-Fi-Ne
* ISFJ = Si-Fe-Ti-Ne
* ENTP = Ne-Ti-Fe-Si
* ENFP = Ne-Fi-Te-Si
* INTJ = Ni-Te-Fi-Si
* INFJ = Ni-Fe-Ti-Si
* ESTJ = Si-Te-Fi-Ne
* ENTJ = Te-Ni-Se-Fi
* ISTP = Ti-Se-Ni-Fe
* INTP = Ti-Ne-Si-Fe
* ESFJ = Fe-Si-Ne-Ti
* ENFJ = Fe-Ni-Se-Ti
* ISFP = Fi-Se-Ni-Te
* INFP = Fi-Ne-Si-Te

### Beebe's Eight Function Model

A pivotal theme scattered throughout many of Jung's work is his reference to archetypes. The archetypes represent universal patterns and images that are part of the collective unconscious. He believed we inherit these archetypes much in the way we inherit instinctive patterns of behaviour. John Beebe set out to reconcile the archetypal complex each function took on depending on its position in the types. From his work he developed his eight function model.

It's important to outline that functions and attitudes are perspectives not behaviours. Having divided reality into two opposite poles, when functions are bought into consciousness by the ego, and when not conscious, they will give rise to felt reactions. They help us interpret reality and as our natural preferences develop so does our behaviour associated with the process.

Archetypes are defined as *"a way of organizing human experience that gives it collective meaning"* and are a concatenation of images, memories, and emotions surrounding an archetypal core, but that is unique to ourselves. Therefore they form a connection to the functions that we use to filter our reality.

An archetype at its core is a **complex** and that complex forms an encasement around the function which the function then operates around that complex.

John Beebe outlined four **basic orientation functions** and four **shadow functions** and **the archetypal complexes** that were associated with each function's position in the stack. Where previous models had only looked at the four ego-syntonic functions, Beebe saw this as only half the story of how consciousness arranges itself and so also incorporated the other four ego-dystonic functions.

The **shadow functions** are the most unconscious functions of our personality and are the four non-preferred functions of the personality type. The shadow functions are in the same function order but in the reverse attitude. So if an ESTP's basic orientation functions are Se-Ti-Fe-Ni then their shadow functions are Si-Te-Fi-Ne. Shadow functions are often the source of the unhealthy aspects of our personality.

Isabel Myers in *'Gifts Differing'* described the shadow as using "relatively childish and primitive kinds of judgment and perception, not intentionally in the service of conscious aims, but all on its own in an escape from the conscious personality and in defiance of conscious standards.”

#### Basic Orientation Functions

##### The Hero or the Dominant function
The function that plays the leading role. We engage this process first and it is our most trusted to solve our problems. It has a mature quality to it and can likely be engaged effortlessly, automatically and requires little energy to engage. As it often get us out of difficult situations it takes on a heroic quality. In its more negative aspect can become overbearing and domineering.

##### The Parent or the Auxiliary function
This function plays a supportive role and is how we are helpful to others and supportive of ourselves. Because of this is takes on a nurturing parent quality. In its more negative aspect it can be overprotective and stunting rather than helpful.

##### The Child or the Tertiary function
This function is one we wield in a playful, exploratory and creative way. It is often seen as aspirational and a relief function that we use to express ourselves in a playful and childlike manner. It requires much more energy than your top two functions and in its more negative aspect is how we become childish and can take on an unsettling quality as it is used to distract ourselves and get us off target.

##### The Anima/Animus or the Inferior function
This function takes on an aspirational role as it is what we aspire to be like. It is often first experienced in its negative aspects used to project our fears and insecurities onto others. These fears and insecurities reflect the role this function plays. It requires a very high energy expenditure to use and as it develops can become a bridge to bring balance to our lives.

#### Shadow Functions

##### The Opposing Personality
This function is how we become stubborn and argumentative refusing to go along with what is happening at the time.

##### Witch/Senex or the Critical Parent
This function is how we find weak spots and can demoralize others. We can also feel this way when others use the process that plays this role. it takes on the quality of a critical parental voice in your head that will cause you to criticise yourself and others.

##### The Trickster of the Bad Child
This function deceives and distorts what you experience. It tricks us into thinking something important to do or pay attention to and can lead us to make mistakes in perception or decision making fooling us into seeing and believing things that are not real. Often leaving us feeling double bound and trapped by two bad options.

##### The Demon
This function is the most destructive and using the function that plays this role we can become destructive to ourselves or others. It carries with it an internal saboteur like quality and carries emotions associated with evil. Either trying to destroy the ego or the ego in turn trying to destroy a perceived threat.
