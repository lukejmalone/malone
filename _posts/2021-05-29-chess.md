## Chess

Around late 2020 I found the game of Chess. Despite never having played growing up, I was drawn to it instantly. For something with a simple set of rules the rich and complex depth that can be found makes chess a truly beautiful game. As Karpov famously quoted "Chess is everything - art, science, and sport."

As a result of this new addiction, I've thrown myself into the world of chess in a quest to get as good as I can. Below is an ongoing list of resources I've found incredibly valuable on this quest.
