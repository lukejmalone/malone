The following is the  simple approach I take to my exercising routine where I alternate between lower body & upper body workouts with added stretching beforehand. This focuses on pain free functional movement, posture and strength. Every exercise and stretch has been selected to counteract the ill effects of the modern life.

### Exercises:

#### Lower body
- Swiss ball jack knife & ab roll
- Flutter kicks & leg raises
- Planks
- Lunges
- Squats
- Bridges
- Kettlebell swings
- Foundation training routine

#### Upper body
- Band pull aparts
- Bent over rows
- Floor dumbbell press
- Pushups
- Dumbbell curls
- Dumbbell shoulder press
- Dips

#### Stretches
- Crucifix stretch
- Thoracic mobility foam roller/wall
- Swiss ball back extension
- Cat cow
- McKenzie press up
- Prone cobra
- Lying chin tuck
- Wood chop
- Sitting QL stretch
- SCM stretch
